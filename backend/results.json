In people with certain types of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, the CFTR protein is not processed and cannot move through the cell normally. This results in little to no protein at the cell surface. Vanzacaftor, formerly known as VX-121, and tezacaftor are designed to increase the amount of mature protein at the cell surface by targeting the processing and trafficking defect of the CFTR protein. Deutivacaftor is a potentiator designed to keep CFTR proteins at the cell surface open longer to improve the flow of salt and water across the cell membrane, which helps hydrate and clear mucus from the airways. The triple combination of vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor is being developed as an investigational once-daily treatment for people with CF with certain mutations in the CFTR gene.For information about ongoing clinical studies in the U.S., visit\u00a0theclinical trials website.

Chu,None.AbstractBackground: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the US, and it remains a significant public health burden. Metastatic CRC (mCRC) is usually treated with combination chemotherapy and targeted therapy regimens, but eventually becomes chemotherapy refractory. Thus, novel and more effective treatments for mCRC are urgently needed. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is a key activator of RNA Pol II transcription and promotes the expression of many cancer driver genes, making CDK9 a promising target for cancer therapy.Methods: Human CRC cell lines, patient-derived organoids (PDOs), cell line xenografts, and patient-derived xenografts were used to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the CDK9 inhibitors AZD4573, enitociclib, and NVP-2, as well as the BRAF inhibitors encorafenib and dabrafenib.In vitroviability was measured by chemical cell proliferation assays andin vivotumor sizes were measured by calipers.In vitromechanisms of action were assessed by RNA sequencing, real time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting.In vivomechanisms of action were assessed by immunohistochemistry.Results: CDK9 inhibitors potently inhibited CRC cells and PDOs. In contrast to hematologic malignancies, we did not observe consistent suppression of the oncogenes c-MYC and MCL-1 by CDK9 inhibitor treatment. Instead, CDK9 inhibitors suppressed several other key cancer pathways in CRC, such as MAPK, mTOR, and PI3K signaling pathways. Importantly, multiple targets within the MAPK pathway were strongly suppressed, including EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF. We hypothesized that combination treatment with CKD9 inhibitors and MAPK pathway inhibitors can synergistically treat CRC. As proof-of-concept, we investigated the combination of CDK9 and BRAF inhibitors in models of BRAF-mutant CRC, a particularly aggressive type of CRC. We found this combination to synergistically suppress CRC growthin vitroandin vivo. Compared to single agents, combination treatment led to significantly stronger induction of apoptosis and suppression of MAPK pathway signaling. Our results suggest that concurrent treatment with CDK9 inhibitors plus established MAPK pathway inhibitors, such as BRAF inhibitors, can significantly improve upon single agent treatment. Conclusions: We have found CDK9 inhibitors to potently suppress CRC growth and survival through a unique mechanism of action, by vertical suppression of the MAPK signaling pathway. We demonstrate that CDK9 inhibitors can synergize with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of BRAF-mutant CRC models. Thus, CDK9 inhibitors are a promising class of drugs warranting further investigation, including early-phase clinical trials, in mCRC.AACR Annual MeetingHomepageMeeting RegistrationCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Association for Cancer Research.

Li,None..W. Zheng,None..Y. Teng,None.AbstractTargeting mitochondrial oncoproteins presents a new concept in developing effective cancer therapeutics. ATAD3A is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme that contributes to mitochondrial dynamics, cholesterol metabolism, and signal transduction. Our previous study has demonstrated elevated expression of ATAD3A in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) primary tissues and cultured cell lines. Loss of function suppresses HNSCC cell growth and elicits tumor regression in orthotopic tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, ATAD3A interacts with ERK1/2 in the mitochondria of HNSCC cells in the presence of VDAC1, and the ATAD3A-ERK1/2 signaling axis drives HNSCC development in a RAS-independent fashion. CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized genome engineering and has been intensively used to modify cancer-associated genes. However, challenges remain as CRISPR editing components must be transported into cells to exert their function. There is a need to explore effective in vivo delivery systems to accelerate the clinical use of CRISPR-Cas9. As no drug is available to target ATAD3A directly, we developed CRISPR-based ATAD3A-targeting nanodrugs by loading Cas9 mRNA and anti-ATAD3A sgRNAs into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that have become clinically acceptable delivery system due to low toxicity and high delivery efficacy and biocompatibility. As expected, treatment tongue tumors established in NSG mice with LNP-sgATAD3A remarkably repressed tumor growth. Most interestingly, the addition of LNP-sgATAD3A to the RAS inhibitor salirasib potentiated anticancer activity for HNSCC compared with the efficacy resulting from single-arm treatment. These novel and significant findings demonstrate a novel approach to inhibiting ATAD3A in tumor cells and provide a possible therapeutic strategy to enhance the success of multimodality therapy in cancer patients.AACR Annual MeetingHomepageMeeting RegistrationCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Association for Cancer Research.

The different mutation spectra in these diseases are reflected in divergent responses to EGFR inhibition: significant patient benefit in lung cancer, but limited in glioblastoma. Here, we report a comprehensive mutational analysis of EGFR function. We performed saturation mutagenesis of EGFR and assessed function of ~22,500 variants in a human EGFR-dependent lung cancer cell line. This approach revealed enrichment of erlotinib-insensitive variants of known and unknown significance in the dimerization, transmembrane, and kinase domains. Multiple EGFR extracellular domain variants, lacking approved targeted therapies, were sensitive to dacomitinib. Strikingly, at least two glioblastoma patients with G598V dimerization domain mutations showed responses to dacomitinib treatment together with subsequent off-target resistance in one case. In summary, this comprehensive screen reveals novel functional EGFR variants and suggests broader clinical investigation of EGFR inhibition for cancers harboring extracellular domain mutations.AACR Annual MeetingHomepageMeeting RegistrationCopyright \u00a9 2024 American Association for Cancer Research.

Although follow-up remain short, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel, ZUMA-5) and tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel, ELARA) demonstrated promising complete response rates (CRR) of 86% and 69%, respectively, in phase II trials including relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL).. Tisa-cel and axi-cel are now approved after at least 2 lines of systemic therapy by the FDA. Few real-word evidence (RWE) data have been reported so far.Methods:Patients were eligible if aged >18 years, had FL histology (grade 1-3A) and had received at least 2 previous treatment lines for tisa-cel and 3 for axi-cel according to the French early access program label. From Dec 2021 to Jan 2023, a total of 112 patients were included in early access program by 21 French centers and in DESCAR-T registry (NCT04328298), among them 87 were infused with a CAR product. At the data cut-off on March 2023, 70 had at least 1 month of follow-up (FU) with PET-CT evaluation, and thus were considered for the safety and efficacy sets (62 tisa-cel and 8 axi-cel,).Results:Patient and disease characteristics were as follows: 46 males (65.7%), median age 62 years (range: 34-79), 3 median prior lines of therapy (range 2-9, including bi-specific antibody in 12.9% and autoSCT in 44.3%), FLIPI 0-2 in 40.5% and 3-5 in 49.5%, bulky disease (>5cm) in 22%, and LDH > N 52.2%. POD24 after 1stsystemic immunochemotherapy (IC) was reported in 44 patients (62.8%). Before CAR T-cell infusion, 58.6% of patients received a bridging therapy (20 (48.8%) chemotherapy, 25 (61%) monoclonal antibodies, 4 (9.8%) kinase inhibitors, 15 (36.6%) lenalidomide, and 3 (7.3%) radiotherapy). All patients but one received a fludarabine and cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion. Median time from order to infusion was 48 days (range 34-204), and 41 days (30-328) from leukapheresis to infusion.Median FU was 7.3 months [6.4; 8.2] from product order, and 5.4 months [3.4; 6] from CAR infusion. Best ORR and CRR were 97.5 and 87.5%, respectively with 72.5% of patients in CR at 1 month with projected DOR and DOCR of 72.4% [56.8; 83.1%], and 79.7% [62.7%; 89.6%], respectively. Projected 6-months PFS, OS, were 71.8% [95% CI, 56.6%; 82.4%], 97.4% [83.2%; 99.6%], respectively. Fifteen (21.4%) patients progressed (median time from infusion to first relapse: 3 months (range 1-10 mo). Only one patient died from lymphoma progression.Any-grade CRS and ICANS were reported for 74.3% and 27.1% of patients, but grade 3-4 CRS/ICANS were very unfrequent,1.4% and 4.3%, respectively. No grade 5 was reported. Persisting grade 3-4 hematologic toxicities at 1 and 3 months were: neutropenia (50% and 12.3%), thrombocytopenia (18.6% and 0%), and anemia (8.6% and 0%). Medically relevant bacterial and viral infections were reported in 20% and 14.3% of patients, respectively.Conclusions:Although longer FU is needed to assess disease control, RWE data from the DESCAR-T registry confirm the excellent response rates and safety profile of CAR T-cells in R/R FL after at least 2 lines of previous therapy.DisclosuresYsebaert:Beigene:Honoraria, Research Funding, Speakers Bureau;Roche:Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding;AstraZeneca:Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding;Janssen:Consultancy, Honoraria, Research Funding;BMS/Celgene:Consultancy, Honoraria;Abbvie:Honoraria, Research Funding, Speakers Bureau;Gilead/Kite:Consultancy, Honoraria.Houot:Kite/Gilead, Novartis, Incyte, Janssen, MSD, Takeda, F.

Historically, the rationale for routine inpatient care during this period has been the facilitation of administration of parenteral medications, prevention of mold infections and the monitoring and management of acute toxicities. However, advances in supportive care and other technologies may allow outpatient management during this period. We analyzed outcomes of all consecutive patients who underwent myeloablative allo-HCT as defined by the CIBMTR (Giralt 2009, BBMT) with planned total outpatient management at our center. Patient characteristics and outcome data were prospectively entered into our institutional database from which they were extracted for this analysis. Patients were scheduled to receive their conditioning regimen and post-transplant care in our purpose-built outpatient clinic. Patients received their stem cell infusion on the inpatient unit and were planned to be discharged home the same day except patients receiving haploidentical transplants who were planned to be discharged on day +5 to accommodate the early cytokine release syndrome commonly seen in such patients (Solomon BBMT 2012). Subsequent admissions were for significant complications necessitating inpatient management only. Our technical approach to total outpatient management of myeloablative allo-HCT was as previously described (Solomon BMT 2010, 45: 468-475). Patients (n=462) were transplanted consecutively between 4/08 and 12/15. Patient characteristics were: median age 46; male (53%); race - white 79%, black 18%, Asian 2%; diagnosis- AML 42%, ALL 21%, MDS/MPS 21%, NHL/HL/CLL 13%, other 3%; donor type - MRD 48%, MUD 35%, Haplo 17%, CBT <1%; graft source- PBSC 87%, BM 12%, BM+PBSC 1%; regimen-busulfan based 60%, TBI based 39%, other 1%; DRI -low 16%, intermediate 48%, high 26%, v. high 10%; HCT-CI- 0-2 (64%), \u22653(36%). The conditioning regimen was entirely delivered in the outpatient clinic as planned in 377 patients (82%). Of 85 (18%) patients who received some of their conditioning regimen in the inpatient setting, in 42(49%) this was to receive drugs not administrable or reimbursed in the outpatient setting, and in 43(51%) it was for management of toxicity. The majority of patients were discharged within 24 hours of stem cell infusion (311 -67%) with the median day of discharge for the remaining patients being d+13 (range d+2 to d+75). Following discharge after stem cell infusion, 82 patients (18%) were never readmitted, days to readmission for the remainder were 0-5 (40%), 6-9 (24%), > 10 (18%). For readmitted patients, most frequent reasons were - febrile neutropenia 33%, mucositis 29%, and lower GI toxicity 4.5%. Median total length of inpatient stay through d+100 was 16 d (range 1-98). Fungal infections were documented in only 3 patients (1%) through d +100. With a median follow-up for surviving patients of 52 months (6-218 months), K-M estimates of survival and DFS at 1 yr are 70% and 61% and at 4 years are 52% and 47% respectively. Cumulative incidences (CI) of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse at 1 yr are 17% and 21% and at 4 yrs are 24% and 29% (Fig.1). CI of acute GVHD grade 2-4 and 3-4 at 6 months were 28% and 10%. CI of moderate to severe, and severe chronic GVHD at 4 years were 30% and 12%. On multivariate analysis, receipt of any part of the conditioning regimen as inpatient was a significant negative factor for survival (HR 1.99, p<0.001), DFS (HR 1.74, p =0.001) and NRM (HR 2.06, p=0.004). These data show that myeloablative allo-HCT performed without routine inpatient admission from conditioning through neutrophil recovery is feasible with low rates of NRM and fungal infection. Median total inpatient stay through d +100 can be reduced to 16 days and nearly 20% of patients can avoid any inpatient stay through d +100. With mature follow-up outcomes appear similar or superior to those commonly reported using a traditional inpatient approach.Figure 1.View largeDownload slideFigure 1.View largeDownload slideClose modalDisclosuresNo relevant conflicts of interest to declare.Topics:allopurinol,ambulatory care facilities,busulfan,cell transplants,cytokine release syndrome,donors,febrile neutropenia,follow-up,graft-versus-host disease, acute,graft-versus-host disease, chronicAuthor notes*Asterisk with author names denotes non-ASH members.\u00a9 2016 by The American Society of Hematology2016Sign in via your InstitutionAdd commentClose comment form modalSubmit a commentNamePlease enter your name.AffiliationsPlease enter your affiliationsComment titlePlease supply a title for your comment.CommentThis field is requiredI agree to the terms and conditions.You must accept the terms and conditions.Read the terms and conditionsYou have entered an invalid code.SubmitCancelThank you for submitting a comment on this article.

Furthermore, intensive induction chemotherapy is often unsuitable for elderly patients and can result in significant periods of inpatient care. Recent understanding of leukemia stem cell cycling suggests that prolonged cytotoxic exposure, e.g. >14\u201321 days, could provide a more effective anti-leukemic effect than the typical 5\u20137 days schedules during which time very few leukemic stem cells would be likely to undergo cell division. We have been using prolonged low-dose cytarabine schedules as reported 20 years ago (Hellstrom-Lindberg, Brit J Haem,1992;81:503), however we have combined this with oral thioguanine, a purine analogue that may synergize with cytarabine. Concomitant filgrastim or pegfilgrastim was given to minimize neutropenia and for its possible synergizing anti-leukemic effect when combined with cytotoxic agents. Encouraging experience with this schedule in a few relapsed/refractory elderly AML patients prompted us to use this strategy in elderly de-novo patients unsuitable for standard induction. Surprisingly good results prompted us to report our preliminary experience with this novel strategy. This report is a retrospective, single-center analysis of outcomes in elderly patients with AML managed as outpatients in an ambulatory care day unit. Between April 2009 and March 2011, 14 patients with either relapsed/refractory AML (n=5) orde novoAML (n=9) unsuitable for intensive therapy were treated using prolonged, low-dose cytarabine 20mg/m2/day subcutaneously and thioguanine 80mg/day orally. Treatment was given for 21 days followed by a 14 day break after which the schedule was repeated until remission. After obtaining remission, patients received a maintenance schedule consisting of 14 days on treatment with rest periods increasing from 14 to 28 days according to tolerance and time on therapy, with an intention to continue maintenance for 2 years. All patients received the treatment in an ambulatory care unit with supportive care including filgrastim or pegfilgrastim, blood and platelet transfusion as required, regular clinical review and prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal agents. Patient age ranged from 52 to 89 years (median 75y). All patients had intermediate or poor risk cytogenetics. A morphologic remission according to bone marrow aspirate was obtained in 8 patients (57.1%), with relapse seen in 1 patient at 2.6 months follow-up. Remission was maintained in 7 patients (50%) with follow-up ranging from 4.7 to 26.6 months (median 9.7 months), including 1 patient who was refractory to standard first and second-line induction chemotherapy. Refractoriness to treatment occurred in 5 patients (35.7%). Mortality relating to disease progression occurred in 3 patients (21.4%) and 1 patient died secondary to infection. All patients developed grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia but severe mucositis was not seen. The infection rate was low and hospital admission was uncommon. Nausea was common but manageable and significant liver toxicity was not observed. This study demonstrates that effective management of AML in elderly patients can be achieved in the outpatient setting. The data suggests a surprising efficacy for this strategy, with a remission rate comparable to that reported using standard induction chemotherapy but with a potentially favorable toxicity profile. A prospective study is now underway to further evaluate this protocol.Disclosures:Arthur:AMGEN:Honoraria.Topics:ambulatory care facilities,cytarabine,filgrastim,leukemia, myelocytic, acute,thioguanine,disease remission,chemotherapy, neoadjuvant,ambulatory care services,follow-up,infectionsAuthor notes*Asterisk with author names denotes non-ASH members.\u00a9 2011 by The American Society of Hematology2011Sign in via your InstitutionAdd commentClose comment form modalSubmit a commentNamePlease enter your name.AffiliationsPlease enter your affiliationsComment titlePlease supply a title for your comment.CommentThis field is requiredI agree to the terms and conditions.You must accept the terms and conditions.Read the terms and conditionsYou have entered an invalid code.SubmitCancelThank you for submitting a comment on this article.

Generally, these patients remain hospitalized until blood count recovery due to the risk for infections and bleeding during pancytopenia. However, a recent small pilot study at our institution suggested that early discharge (ED) following induction/salvage therapy for MDS/AML may be safe and may reduce cost. We therefore conducted a phase 2 study to test this care strategy in a larger cohort of patients (NCT01235572).MethodsPatients aged 18-75 years with high-risk MDS or AML (other than acute promyelocytic leukemia) were enrolled before or during induction or salvage chemotherapy and provided with outpatient care teaching. Patients were considered eligible for ED if they fulfilled the following medical and logistic criteria: ECOG performance status of 0-1, adequate organ function; no active bleeding; agreeable to close outpatient follow-up; reliable caregiver; and residency within 60 minutes of the outpatient clinic. Patients who met medical but not logistic criteria served as inpatient controls. If readmitted, ED was again possible if all medical/logistic criteria were met. Patients remained on protocol until blood count recovery, additional chemotherapy was administered, or a maximum of 45 days. Our goal was to compare the number of early deaths, healthcare costs and resource utilization among ED patients versus inpatient controls. Safety was monitored with early stopping if the early death rate was >7% in the ED group, with a predefined interim analysis after 30 patients. All data are provided as median (range).ResultsOne hundred and seven eligible patients were enrolled over a 2-year period. Two patients died during chemotherapy. Twenty-seven patients failed to meet medical ED criteria after completion of chemotherapy and were taken off study, mostly due to poor performance status. Eighteen patients, age 51.4 (22-70) years, met medical but not logistic ED criteria and served as controls; they were followed for 14 (9-41) days, with 7 patients taken off study at the time of hospital discharge before blood count recovery. Sixty patients, age 51.6 (22-71) years, met all ED criteria and were discharged upon completion of induction (n=19) or salvage (n=41) chemotherapy for AML (n=50) or MDS (n=10). A median number of 1 (1-3) readmission occurred in 53 of these patients, primarily for neutropenic fever; 8 patients were readmitted twice and 3 patients were readmitted 3 times prior to coming off study. Overall, ED patients spent 12.8 (0-38) and 7.5 (0-33) days as out- and inpatients, respectively, for a total of 62.7% (0-100%) of the study time spent as outpatients. ED patients required 0.41 (0-1.9) clinic visits and 0.13 (0-0.66) physician visits per outpatient day. Duration of IV antibiotics was similar in ED and control patients (10 [0-40] vs 12 [0-40] days; p=0.38) as was number of red blood cell transfusions (0.27 [0.0-0.94] vs 0.29 [0.08-0.548] units/study day; p=0.21). In contrast, ED patients required fewer platelet transfusions (0.21 [0.09-1.25] vs 0.33 [0.21-0.80] units/ study day; p=0.02). Six patients in the ED group required between 1-6 days of intensive care unit (ICU) care (p= 0.17 for the difference in ICU days between discharges and controls). Three deaths occurred in the ED group during the study period: two of sepsis (2 and 7 days after readmission), and one of fungal sinusitis (11 days after readmission). The median daily total professional and facility charges, dated from the day of re-evaluation until removal from protocol, were significantly lower for patients discharged early compared to inpatient controls: $3,871 [$360.86-$13,361] vs $6,283 [$4,868-$11,898], p<0.001), due to significantly lower daily charges during outpatient care ($1375/outpatient day) relative to daily inpatient charges. Among readmitted patients, daily costs per inpatient-day were relatively similar to the control patients ($7,332 vs $6,282/inpatient-day, p=0.06).ConclusionWith appropriate outpatient support measures, ED of patients following induction/salvage therapy for MDS/AML appears safe. Although readmission is common, a policy of ED results in a substantial reduction of the duration of inpatient stay and significantly reduces the economic burden of AML/MDS therapy.Disclosures:No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.Topics:acute promyelocytic leukemia,ambulatory care services,antibiotic therapy, intravenous,chemotherapy regimen,chemotherapy, neoadjuvant,disease remission,electrocorticogram,erythrocyte transfusion,febrile neutropenia,follow-upAuthor notes*Asterisk with author names denotes non-ASH members.This icon denotes a clinically relevant abstract\u00a9 2013 by The American Society of Hematology2013Sign in via your InstitutionAdd commentClose comment form modalSubmit a commentNamePlease enter your name.AffiliationsPlease enter your affiliationsComment titlePlease supply a title for your comment.CommentThis field is requiredI agree to the terms and conditions.You must accept the terms and conditions.Read the terms and conditionsYou have entered an invalid code.SubmitCancelThank you for submitting a comment on this article.

The clinical trial is designed to assess the impact of inaxaplin on kidney function and proteinuria for people living with proteinuric kidney disease mediated by two variants in theAPOL1gene, known as AMKD. In addition, the trial has been expanded to include adolescents with AMKD ages 10 to 17 years.Previously reported Phase 2a proof-of-concept data demonstrated that inaxaplin led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction in the urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 47.6% at 13 weeks of treatment compared to baseline, providing the first clinical evidence that an oral small molecule APOL1 inhibitor can decrease proteinuria in people with AMKD.\u201cInaxaplin, a first-in-class molecule that addresses the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, has already shown impressive results in the Phase 2a proof-of-concept study,\u201d saidCarmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President,Global Medicines Developmentand Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer atVertex. \u201cAdvancing this trial into Phase 3 and broadening the trial to include younger patients is a critical step forward in bringing this potential therapy to patients who are waiting.\u201d\u201cAMKD is a rapidly progressing condition and often remains silent until the disease reaches an advanced stage. We have no approved disease-specific therapies for this truly devastating condition, and inaxaplin has the potential to transform the care of AMKD and significantly improve the lives of patients,\u201d notedGlenn M. Chertow, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Medicine,Stanford University School of Medicine, and Chair of Vertex\u2019sAPOL1 Program Steering Committee. \u201cThe kidney community is strongly encouraged by inaxaplin\u2019s potential, which energizes those of us caring for patients with AMKD.\u201dAn Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed blinded and unblinded Phase 2 safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2/3 pivotal trial, which evaluated two different doses of inaxaplin compared to placebo for 12 weeks of treatment in patients ages 18 to 65 years and recommended the selection of a single inaxaplin dose of 45 mg once daily in the Phase 3 portion of the Phase 2/3 study. The IDMC also recommended enrolling adolescents with AMKD ages 10 to 17 years in the Phase 3 portion of the study.TheU.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has granted inaxaplin Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPD) and Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for APOL1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). TheEuropean Medicines Agency(EMA) has also granted inaxaplin Priority Medicines (PRIME) and Orphan Drug designations for AMKD.About the Phase 2/3 AMPLITUDE StudyInaxaplin is a potential first-in-class, investigational small molecule inhibitor of APOL1 with the goal of targeting the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD).The primary efficacy endpoint for the final analysis is estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope in patients receiving inaxaplin compared to placebo. The secondary efficacy endpoint is time to composite clinical outcome, which will also be assessed at the final analysis and is defined as a sustained decline of \u226530% from baseline in the eGFR, the onset of end-stage kidney disease or death. The final study analysis will occur when subjects have at least two years of eGFR data and when approximately 187 composite clinical outcomes have occurred.The study is also designed to have a pre-planned interim analysis at Week 48 evaluating eGFR slope, supported by a percent change from baseline in proteinuria in the inaxaplin arm versus placebo. If positive, the interim analysis may serve as the basis forVertexto seek accelerated approval of inaxaplin in theU.S.for patients with AMKD.Enrollment in the study is ongoing, with more than 200 sites open in theU.S.and internationally.About APOL1-Mediated Kidney DiseaseAPOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD) is a form of chronic kidney disease caused by variants in theAPOL1gene. Approximately 100,000 people in theU.S.andEuropehave twoAPOL1genetic variants and proteinuric kidney disease. People who inherit two variants in theAPOL1gene have a course of disease that is far more aggressive than in the absence ofAPOL1genetic variants. InheritedAPOL1genetic variants may lead to kidney cell injury, cell death and damage to the glomeruli (which filter blood in the kidney). This leads to protein in the urine (known as \u201cproteinuria\u201d) and decreased ability of the kidney to function, which can lead to dialysis, transplant or death.AboutVertexVertexis a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

The Phase 3 program included two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pivotal trials, one following abdominoplasty surgery and one following bunionectomy surgery, as well as a single arm safety and effectiveness study which enrolled patients with a broad range of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.Treatment with VX-548 following abdominoplasty or bunionectomy surgery resulted in a statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint of the time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference from 0 to 48 hours (SPID48) compared to placebo as well as a clinically meaningful reduction in pain from baseline at 48 hours on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) in both studies (abdominoplasty: LS mean difference in SPID48 between VX-548 and placebo = 48.4 (95% CI: 33.6, 63.1;P<0.0001); bunionectomy: LS mean difference in SPID48 between VX-548 and placebo = 29.3 (95% CI: 14.0, 44.6;P=0.0002)).For the first key secondary endpoint,Vertextested the hypothesis that VX-548 was superior to hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (HB/APAP) on SPID48 following abdominoplasty surgery or bunionectomy surgery. Neither trial met this key secondary endpoint (abdominoplasty: LS mean difference between VX-548 and HB/APAP = 6.6 (95% CI: -5.4, 18.7;P=0.2781); bunionectomy: LS mean difference between VX-548 and HB/APAP = -20.2 (95% CI: -32.7, -7.7;P=0.0016)).The second key secondary endpoint in both trials was time to meaningful pain relief defined as \u22652-point reduction in NPRS from baseline compared to placebo. VX-548 had a more rapid onset to meaningful pain relief than placebo in both the abdominoplasty and bunionectomy trials. (The median time to meaningful pain relief was 8 hours for placebo in both studies compared to 2 hours in abdominoplasty and 4 hours in bunionectomy for VX-548, with nominalP<0.0001 and 0.0016, respectively.)Other secondary endpoints in both trials were generally consistent with the primary endpoint.The Phase 3 single arm safety and effectiveness study evaluated treatment with VX-548 for up to 14 days across a broad range of other surgical and non-surgical acute pain conditions and demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability, as well as effectiveness as measured by a Patient Global Assessment (PGA) at the end of treatment (83.2% of patients rated VX-548 as good, very good, or excellent in treating pain).VX-548 was safe and well tolerated in all three Phase 3 studies. The majority of adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate, and there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to VX-548. In general, AEs in the two randomized controlled trials were consistent with the post-surgical setting. In the VX-548 arm, the incidence of AEs was lower than placebo (patients with any AEs in VX-548 and placebo arms: 50.0% and 56.3%, respectively, following abdominoplasty, and 31.0% and 35.2%, respectively, following bunionectomy).\u201cWe are very pleased with the results from the VX-548 pivotal program, which demonstrate a compelling and consistent combination of efficacy and safety across multiple acute pain conditions and settings. The VX-548 benefit-risk profile ideally positions it to potentially fill the gap between medicines with good tolerability but limited efficacy and opioid medicines with therapeutic efficacy but known risks, including addictive potential,\u201d saidReshma Kewalramani, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and President ofVertex. \u201cWith FDA Breakthrough and Fast Track Designations in hand, we are working with urgency to file the New Drug Application for VX-548 and bring this non-opioid medicine to the millions of patients who suffer from acute pain each year in the U.S.\u201d\u201cAs a physician treating patients suffering from pain for many years, I know firsthand the critical need for new, efficacious and safe treatment options,\u201d saidJessica Oswald, M.D., M.P.H.,Associate Physician in Emergency Medicine and Pain Medicine,University of California San Diego, andVertex Acute Pain Steering CommitteeMember. \u201cThe Phase 3 safety and efficacy across the three studies are impressive and demonstrate VX-548\u2019s potential to change the paradigm of pain management. I look forward to the potential of having a new class of acute pain medicine \u2014 the first in more than two decades \u2014 to use as an alternative to opioids to help the millions of people impacted by acute pain.\u201dVX-548 Phase 3 Results in Patients Undergoing AbdominoplastyEfficacy ResultsPatients aged 18 to 80 years with moderate or severe pain after abdominoplasty surgery were eligible to participate in the trial. 1,118 patients were randomized and dosed with either VX-548 administered orally with an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours (at 12, 24 and 36 hours after the first dose), hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (5 mg/325 mg administered orally every 6 hours over 42 hours), or placebo.Primary and Key Secondary Outcomes in Phase 3 Study of Acute Pain Following AbdominoplastyPlaceboN=223HB/APAPN=448VX-548N=447Primary endpoint of SPID48 vs. placeboLS mean SPID48 (SE)70.1 (6.1)--118.4 (4.3)LS mean SPID48 difference from placebo----48.495% CI----(33.6, 63.1)Pvalue vs. placebo----<0.0001First key secondary endpoint of SPID48 vs. HB/APAPLS mean SPID48 (SE)--111.8 (4.3)118.4 (4.3)LS mean SPID48 difference from HB/APAP----6.695% CI----(-5.4, 18.7)Pvalue vs. HB/APAP----0.2781Second key secondary endpoint of time to \u22652-point reduction in NPRS from baseline vs. placebo (minutes)Median time480--11995% CI(477, 705)--(90, 180)Pvalue* vs. placebo (Log-rank)----<0.0001*Pvalue is nominal; CI = confidence interval; LS = least squares; SE = standard error.NPRS Reductions From Baseline at 48 Hours in Phase 3 Study of Acute Pain Following AbdominoplastyPlaceboN=223HB/APAPN=448VX-548N=447Baseline NPRS, mean7.57.47.3Change from baseline in NPRS at 48 hours, mean-2.3-3.2-3.4% reduction from baseline in mean NPRS at 48 hours31%43%47%Safety ResultsVX-548 was generally well tolerated in this study.

Treatment with VX-548 administered orally with an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for up to 14 days demonstrated safety, tolerability and effectiveness across these populations.VX-548 was generally safe and well tolerated in this study. AEs were mostly mild or moderate, and there were no SAEs related to VX-548. The safety profile in this study was generally consistent with randomized, controlled Phase 3 studies with VX-548.Patient perception of VX-548 effectiveness in treating pain as measured by a patient global assessment (PGA) at the end of treatment showed 83.2% of patients reporting VX-548 as good, very good, or excellent.Next Steps for the Pain PortfolioVertexplans to submit a New Drug Application to theFood and Drug Administration(FDA) by mid-2024 with the goal of achieving a broad label in moderate-to-severe acute pain. VX-548 has secured Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations in theU.S.for acute pain.In addition,Vertexseeks to achieve a broad label in peripheral neuropathic pain. In support of this goal, the company recently reportedpositive Phase 2 results in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)and expects to advance to pivotal development in DPN with VX-548 following the end-of-phase 2 meeting with the FDA.Vertexhas also initiated a Phase 2 peripheral neuropathic pain study of VX-548 in patients with painful lumbosacral radiculopathy, or LSR, which is pain caused by impairment or injury to nerve roots in the area of the lumbar spine.In line with its portfolio strategy,Vertexcontinues to advance preclinical and clinical development of additional NaV1.8 and NaV1.7 inhibitors, for use alone or in combination, in acute and neuropathic pain.Conference Call and WebcastThe company will host a conference call and webcast at8:00 a.m. ETonJanuary 30, 2024.

Due to limited treatment options, there is an unmet need in acute pain management to improve the patient experience and reduce the economic and societal burden.About VX-548VX-548 is an investigational oral, selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor that is highly selective for NaV1.8 relative to other NaV channels. NaV1.8 is a voltage-gated sodium channel that plays a critical role in pain signaling in the peripheral nervous system. NaV1.8 is a genetically validated target for the treatment of pain, andVertexhas previously demonstrated positive proof-of-concept results and a well-tolerated profile with VX-548 in two Phase 2 studies of acute pain following abdominoplasty and bunionectomy surgeries and in a Phase 2 study in painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a type of peripheral neuropathic pain. Vertex\u2019s approach is to selectively inhibit NaV1.8 using small molecules with the objective of creating a new class of medicines that have the potential to provide effective relief of pain without the limitations of opioids, including their addictive potential. VX-548 is one of the most recent molecules to enter clinical development from Vertex\u2019s portfolio of NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitors.AboutVertexVertexis a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to discuss some of the highlights from the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, and of course, a compelling year we have ahead. I'd like to begin with a few reflections on 2023.As you know, we missed our initial internal projections and Street expectations predominantly related to our COVID products, which affected our stock price performance. Despite however this challenging year, there were a few great things that happened in 2023 that may have gotten lost amid the mixed expectations. First, in 2023, Pfizer impacted the lives of more than 620 million people approximately around the world. We believe there is no other company that can reach as many people and patients as Pfizer.If you multiply this with our brand equity and awareness, it creates a connection with consumers that can be a very strong asset for us. Second, despite the decline in revenue from our COVID products, as of the reported results for the first nine months of 2023, we were the No. 1 pharmaceutical company in terms of revenues from pharma-only products, a marked improvement from our fourth position in 2019. Next, 2023 was a record year for FDA approvals with nine new molecular entity approvals on Pfizer and many more approvals for new indications in already approved products, marking a very productive year of pipeline execution for Pfizer.Finally, we closed the Seagen acquisition. In the current regulatory environment, being able to close such a large acquisition demonstrates our ability to successfully engage with regulatory bodies. Our deliberate and strategic efforts throughout 2023 created a strong foundation to support us. We are now focused on maximizing the opportunities that have positioned us for success and our team is driving confidently as we start 2024.From the advent of penicillin to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has been at the forefront of medical and pharmaceutical breakthroughs for the past 175 years. This year is our 175th anniversary. That can not only change patient lives but has changed history. Our strategy to continue to build on our proud history of innovation and commercial excellence is supported by the power and strength of our unmatched global scale and footprint, spanning commercial, financial, medical, regulatory, manufacturing, and government relations.We have a clear view on how we will deliver operational, commercial, and financial success across our business. Our confidence stems from the opportunity we have to bring additional focus to our business by executing five strategic priorities. We will get into each in more detail but the five key priorities for Pfizer this year is here are: First of all, to achieve world-class oncology leadership, to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation, to maximize the performance of our new products, expand margins by realigning our cost base, allocate capital to enhance shareholder value. I'm confident that Pfizer is well-positioned to execute and that we can deliver meaningful value for our patients and our shareholders.Let's start with our first priority which is to achieve a world-class oncology leadership, which I believe we are in a strong position to do. As a reminder, one in three people will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Oncology represents one of the largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas. Completing the acquisition of Seagen doubled our oncology research and resources overnight, and meaningfully extended the reach and medical impact of our U.S.commercial and medical footprint, with a range of portfolio expansion opportunities boosted by Seagen's broad and deep pipeline. Seagen's in-line medicines are expected to immediately enhance Pfizer's top-line growth, and our combined portfolio provides the opportunity to lead genitourinary cancers and be a leader in breast cancer and deliver at least eight potential blockbuster products by 2030. We look forward to providing more information about our oncology platform at our Pfizer Oncology Innovation Day on February 29th. As we build our leadership position, we have multiple potential key oncology catalysts in 2024 that we are acutely focused on.On the commercial side, the Padcev launch in locally advanced/metastatic bladder cancer in combination with pembrolizumab and Xtandi launch in nonmetastic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We are excited by the strength of the Padcev EV-302 data and recent FDA approval, as it represents an opportunity to broaden the reach of this potentially practice-changing, platinum-free regimen to even more patients in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting. Essentially, the recent approval doubles the addressable population, which had already doubled this past spring. We are also looking forward to phase 3 Data readouts from Vepdegestrant in second line HR+ metastatic breast cancer and Braftovi in first line BRAF colorectal cancer.We also plan to advance our late-stage pipeline with phase 3 starts of CDK4i in post-CDK4/6 metastatic breast cancer and B6A in non-small cell lung cancer. Building on Pfizer's potential medicines, the pipeline across breast cancer, genitourinary cancer, hematology, and CRC, our CDK4 inhibitor could be a compelling follow-on to IBRANCE. And finally, in the early stage pipeline, we look forward to initiating first-in-patient studies of four new ADC candidates this year, where we believe we have acquired the expertise to be a leader. Our second priority is to deliver the next wave of pipeline innovation with discovery and development across our therapeutic areas outside of Oncology in Vaccines, Anti-Infectives, Internal Medicine Metabolic Diseases, and Inflammation and Immunology.In 2024, we plan to continue to make meaningful investments in R&D. In fact, Pfizer's R&D budget is one of the highest in the industry and supports our robust pipeline. We are pursuing cutting-edge science across modalities and platforms to deliver the next generation of potential breakthroughs. We are also leveraging AI and other digital tools across the value chain to increase speed and success rates.Starting first with our 4th-generation PCV vaccine candidate, which recently entered the clinic and received FDA Fast Track designation. Building on our deep heritage with PREVNAR, we aim to solidify our leadership in the pneumococcal vaccine space by increasing valency and serotype immunogenicity while maintaining our unique FDA label, which includes both IPD and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. Respiratory vaccine combinations are another area where we are poised to lead, building upon our successful COVID vaccine. With the first-generation stand-alone mRNA flu vaccine, data demonstrated superior relatively efficacy versus a recommended flu vaccine in 18-to-64-year-olds, but did not meet success criteria for immunogenicity for the B strains.Our second-generation flu vaccine was tested in a phase 2 COVID/Flu combination study for 18\u201364-year-olds and has shown encouraging results in both the A and the B strains. This new construct has now moved already into a phase 3 COVID/Flu combination trial. Moving next to GBT-601. Our next-generation and potentially best-in-class HbS polymerization inhibitor represents a potential step-wise evolution over Oxbryta for sickle cell disease.Recent data presented at ASH 2023 demonstrated multiple blood parameters approaching normal ranges with treatment, suggesting GBT-601 may have the potential to deliver strong efficacy with the convenience of a once-daily pill. We have reaffirmed our commitment to our emerging cardiometabolic programs, with several early clinical development compounds. On the other end of the weight management spectrum, we have Ponsegromab, our GDF15 neutralizing antibody for cancer cachexia with phase 2 data expected later this year. Ponsegromab has the potential to be first-in-class and the first FDA-approved treatment for cancer cachexia, which accounts for 20%, 30% of all cancer deaths significantly.Our third priority is of course to maximize the performance of our new products and core franchises through a relentless focus on execution, to continue growing our top line. To do this, we are prioritizing and focusing, while leveraging data to make changes quickly and adapt. Our Pfizer U.S. Commercial and our Pfizer International Commercial organizations will leverage a more focused, efficient structure to drive executional excellence in their respective markets and expand reach to drive growth over the next several years.To discuss a few examples, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the potential of Nurtec to help the more than one billion people living with migraines worldwide. As access and prescriptions in the U.S. and globally continue to increase, we will continue to focus on direct-to-consumer marketing and reducing barriers to access and affordability for healthcare practitioners and patients. With Oxbryta, we will continue to educate healthcare practitioners and patients on the importance of proactively treating the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by reframing treatment goals to chronic/proactive treatment.With Abrysvo, we are focused on increasing overall RSV market growth and market share by establishing RSV vaccination as a year-round discussion and expanding our retail contracting and offerings. With Elrexfio, we are focused on educating healthcare practitioners in both academic institutions and in the community, awareness building, and new patient trialists. Coming off the initial launch of Velsipity, we are focused on helping ensure patient access to Velsipity as a first-line advanced therapy oral option. With Litfulo, we continue to accelerate the consideration of advanced systemic treatments for appropriate alopecia areata patients and further unlock access to Litfulo.In addition, of course, we continue to protect and grow our core franchises and key blockbusters, including Prevnar, Vyndaqel, and Eliquis, while exploring further opportunities to advance a number of innovative combination regimens. We believe we are well-positioned to bring our global commercial manufacturing and supply capabilities to accelerate current and future marketed products. We believe all these components support our growth potential through 2024 and drive growth potential into 2025. We plan to provide updates throughout the year on how we are advancing these strategic priorities.And with that, I will turn the call over to Dave, who will discuss our financial performance, our initiative to realign our cost base, and our capital allocation strategy to enhance shareholder value. Dave?Dave Denton--Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. As we enter 2024, we are clearly focused on a small number of critical priorities. These priorities include building a world-class oncology organization, ensuring the next wave of pipeline innovations, maximizing our new product portfolio performance with a more efficient commercial structure, and finally right-sizing our cost base. With that said, I'll start this morning with our full-year and our fourth-quarter results, then I'll touch on our capital allocation priorities.I'll finish this morning with a few comments on our 2024 guidance and the near-term expectations that set this year as a foundational year to drive our growth potential in the latter half of the decade. For the full-year 2023, we recorded revenues of $58.5 billion, achieving 7% operational growth, solidly in line with our expectations when excluding contributions from both Comirnaty and Paxlovid. The significant sales decline in our COVID products, including a $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid, were the primary drivers of an overall 41% operational decrease year-over-year. And with the expectation that Seagen will be a substantial growth contributor in 2024 and beyond, our full-year and fourth-quarter results include approximately $120 million in Seagen product revenue after the close of the acquisition on December 14th.On the bottom line, we reported full-year 2023 diluted EPS of $0.37 a share, a 93% year-over-year decline, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.84, down 72% versus year-over-year. This decline is primarily due to a significant decrease in sales for both Comirnaty and Paxlovid; the impact of the $3.5 billion revenue reversal for Paxlovid revenues in the fourth quarter related to an expected return of an estimated 6.5 million unused EUA-labeled treatment courses from the U.S. government; and finally a non-cash inventory write-off and other charges of $5.6 billion recorded in the third quarter for Paxlovid and to a lesser extent Comirnaty. Now turning to the quarter, I'd like to highlight that we delivered a solid 8% year-over-year operational revenue growth, again, excluding Comirnaty and Paxlovid.Contributing to this strong performance were our newly approved RSV vaccine as well as Vyndaqel and Eliquis; partially offset by lower revenues for Ibrance and the Prevnar Family. However, our Q4 results, both top and bottom line, continued to be significantly, and negatively, impacted by our COVID products on a year-on-year basis. Revenues declined 42% operationally, the results were significant decrease in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased by 12 percentage points driven primarily by the $3.5 billion non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal, and to a much lesser extent, unfavorable changes in sales mix.Overall, our adjusted operating expenses declined 10%, compared to Q4 of last year. Adjusted SI&A expenses increased 1% operationally in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of marketing and promotional activities, including those related to recently launched and acquired products. And consistent with our strategy, we have been focused on reprioritizing our R&D spending to enhance overall returns. Adjusted R&D expenses decreased 24% operationally, driven primarily by lower spending across both vaccine programs and certain acquired assets, as well as lower compensation-related expenses.Both our reported diluted loss per share of $0.60 and our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.10 for the quarter were negatively impacted by the $3.5 billion Paxlovid revenue reversal, which dampened EPS by approximately $0.54. Continued declines in both Comirnaty and Paxlovid sales also negatively affected our performance in the quarter. Foreign exchange movements had an immaterial impact compared to last year's fourth quarter. As we are increasingly focused on prioritizing our investments to drive forward-looking growth, our GAAP results include a $1.4 billion intangible asset impairment charge associated with etrasimod, based on changes in development plans for additional indications and overall revenue expectations.But I will point out that this product is still projected to contribute over a $1 billion in peak annual sales. Additionally, we recorded a nearly $1 billion intangible asset impairment for Prevnar 13 reflecting a transition to vaccines with higher sero-type coverage. As discussed in prior quarters, our capital allocation strategy is designed to enhance shareholder value and is based on three core pillars. First is growing our dividend.Second is reinvesting in the business.",
